The '''Toyota Corolla''' is a line of [[subcompact car|subcompact]] and [[compact car]]s manufactured by [[Toyota]].  Introduced in 1966, the Corolla was the best-selling car worldwide by 1974 and has been one of the best-selling cars in the world since then. In 1997, the Corolla became the [[List of automobile sales by model|best selling nameplate in the world]], surpassing the [[Volkswagen Beetle]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2006/corolla/key_features/history.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620034142/http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2006/corolla/key_features/history.html | title = History of the Corolla | publisher = Toyota | location = USA | archivedate = 2006-06-20 | accessdate = 2013-03-20}}</ref> Toyota reached the milestone of 40 million Corollas sold over eleven generations in July 2013.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/07/toyota-says-you-might-have-40-millionth-corolla-ever-built/ | title = Toyota says you might have the 40-millionth Corolla ever built | author = Jeffrey N. Ross | work = Autoblog | date = 2013-09-07 | accessdate = 2013-09-07}}</ref> The series has undergone several major redesigns.

The name ''[[Corolla (chaplet)|Corolla]]'' is part of Toyota's naming tradition of using names derived from the [[Toyota Crown]] for sedans, with ''"[[wikt:corolla|corolla]]"'' [[Latin]] for "small crown".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mondale |first1=Walter |last2=Weston |first2=Mark |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZdHULQZptYC&printsec=frontcover |title=Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Most Influential Men and Women |location=New York City |publisher=Kodansha America |page=63 |isbn=1-56836-324-9 |quote=Since then many Toyota models have taken up the 'Crown' theme. 'Corona,' for example, is Latin for crown. 'Corolla' is Latin for small crown.}}</ref> The Corolla has always been exclusive in Japan to ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]'' locations, and manufactured in Japan with a twin, called the [[Toyota Sprinter]] until 2000. In Japan and much of the world, the hatchback companion since 2006 has been called the [[Toyota Auris]]. Prior to the Auris, Toyota used the Corolla name on the hatchback bodystyle in various international markets.

Early models were mostly [[rear-wheel drive]], while later models have been [[front-wheel drive]]. [[Four-wheel drive]] versions have also been produced. The Corolla's traditional competitors have been the [[Nissan Sunny]], introduced the same year as the Corolla in Japan and the later [[Honda Civic]]. The Corolla's chassis designation code is "E", as described in Toyota's chassis and engine codes.

==Production locations==
[[File:Toyota Corolla production map.svg|thumb|right|Countries and territories where the Toyota Corolla has been produced. Red indicates Japan, blue indicates countries where the Corolla is currently produced, and green indicates countries where the Corolla was formerly produced.]]

Corollas are manufactured in Japan at the original [[Toyota Takaoka Assembly Plant|Toyota Takaoka]] location built in 1966. Various production facilities have been built in [[Brazil]], ([[Indaiatuba]], [[São Paulo]]), [[Canada]] ([[Cambridge, Ontario]]), [[People's Republic of China|China]] ([[Tianjin]]), [[India]] ([[Bangalore]]), [[Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]]), [[South Africa]] ([[Durban]]), [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Turkey]] and [[Venezuela]]. Production has previously been carried out in [[Australia]] ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Derbyshire]]).
Production in the [[United States]] (at [[NUMMI]] in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], California) ended in March 2010.<ref name="Bloomberg20090828">{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aJlxuxndoOsM | title = Toyota Will Shut its California Plant in First Closure | accessdate = 2009-08-29 | date = 2009-08-28 | first1 = Alan | last1 = Ohnsman | first2 = Kae | last2 = Inoue | publisher = Bloomberg L.P.}}</ref> Production resumed the following year after the [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi]] plant was opened in November 2011 in [[Blue Springs, Mississippi]].<ref name="Toyota - Our Business Description, TMMMS">{{cite web | url = http://www.toyota.com/about/our_business/engineering_and_manufacturing/tmmms/index.html | title = Toyota's Business Description, US plants | accessdate = 2013-02-20 | date = 2011-12-31 | author = Toyota Motor North America, Inc. | publisher = Toyota | location = USA}}</ref>

== Alternative versions ==
In Japan, the Corolla has always been exclusive to the Japanese retail sales chain called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]'', which was previously established in 1961, known as ''Toyota Public Store'', selling the [[Toyota Publica]]. A [[badge engineered]] version called the '''[[Toyota Sprinter|Sprinter]]''' was introduced around the same time as the Corolla in Japan, and sold through a different Toyota Japan dealership sales channel known since 1966 as ''Toyota Auto Store.''

There have been several models over the years, including the '''[[Toyota Corolla Ceres|Corolla Ceres]]''' (and similar Sprinter Marino) hardtop, '''[[Toyota AE86|Corolla Levin]]''' and '''[[Toyota AE86|Sprinter Trueno]]''' sports coupés and hatchbacks, and the Corolla FX hatchback, which became the '''Corolla RunX''', while the '''Sprinter''' became the '''[[Toyota Allex|Allex]], ''' with the introduction of the ZZE128 Corolla. The RunX and Allex was replaced by the '''[[Toyota Auris|Auris]]''' in 2006 (known only as '''Corolla''' in markets outside Japan, Europe and South Africa). A luxury version of the Auris installed with V6 engines was briefly sold at Japanese Toyota dealerships ''Toyota Store'' and ''Toyopet Store'' locations as the '''[[Toyota Blade|Blade]],''' which was discontinued in 2012.

A [[compact MPV]] named the '''Corolla Verso''' has also been released in European markets. Its Japanese counterpart is the '''[[Toyota Corolla Spacio|Corolla Spacio]]''', which has been discontinued as of the 10th generation. The '''[[Toyota Corolla Rumion|Corolla Rumion]]''' is also sold in the US-market as the [[Scion xB]].

The [[Toyota Matrix|Corolla Matrix]], better known just as the Matrix, shares the E120 and E140 platforms, and is considered the hatchback/[[Crossover (automobile)|sport wagon]] counterpart of the North American Corolla sedan, as the European/Australasian Corolla hatchback is not sold there. Toyota frequently combines the sales figures of the Corolla sedan and Matrix. The [[Pontiac Vibe]], which is the [[General Motors]] badged version of the Matrix, shares the Corolla platform. The Pontiac Vibe was exported from Fremont, California to the Japanese market where it was sold as the '''Toyota Voltz'''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/080702-Toyota-Corolla-Now-America-s-Best-Selling-Vehicle-/ | title = Toyota Corolla Now America's Best-Selling Vehicle | publisher = U.S. News Rankings and Reviews | date = 2008-07-02 | accessdate = 2010-12-14}}</ref>

Over many years, there have been [[badge engineering|rebadged]] versions of the Corolla, sold by [[General Motors]], including the [[Holden Nova]] in Australia during the early 1990s, and the Sprinter-based [[Chevrolet Nova]], [[Chevrolet Prizm]], and [[Geo Prizm]] (in the United States). The Corolla liftback (TE72) of [[Toyota Australia]] was badged as simply the '''T-18'''. The five-door liftback was sold with the '''Corolla Seca''' name in Australia and the nameplate survived on successive five-door models.

The [[Daihatsu Charmant]] was produced from the E30 to the E70 series.

The [[Toyota Tercel|Tercel]] was a front wheel drive car, first introduced in 1980 at Japanese Toyota dealerships called ''Toyota Corolla Store'', and was called the '''Corolla Tercel''' then, and later given its own name in 1984. The Tercel platform was also used for the [[Toyota Tercel#L20|Corolla II]] hatchback in Japan.

The first Corolla generation was introduced in October 1966 with the new 1100 cc [[Toyota K engine|K]] [[pushrod]] engine. The [[Toyota Sprinter|Corolla Sprinter]] was introduced as the fastback version in 1968, and exclusive to a Toyota Japan dealership retail outlet called ''Toyota Auto Store''.

In May 1970, the E20 was restyled with a more rounded body. The now mutually exclusive Corolla and Sprinter names were used to differentiate between two slightly different treatments of sheet metal and trim. The Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno names were introduced as the enhanced performance version of the Corolla and Sprinter respectively when a [[DOHC|double overhead camshaft]] version of the [[Toyota T engine#2T-G|2T]] engine was introduced in March 1972 (TE27).

In September 1970, the 1400&nbsp;cc T and 1600&nbsp;cc 2T [[OHV]] engines were added to the range.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1971-toyota-corolla-1600-archived-instrumented-test |title=1971 Toyota Corolla 1600 - Archived Instrumented Test - Car Reviews |journal=Car and Driver |location=US |date=February 1971 |access-date=2017-03-04}}</ref>

In Australia, only the 3K powered 2-door KE20 was available as a sedan and wagon / panelvan. The brakes were single system with no booster, solid discs on the front and rear drums. Front sway bar but no rear sway bar. Parts are not compatible with later models.

In NZ, the 4-door KE20 was available.

Most models stopped production in July 1974 but the KE26 wagon and van were still marketed in Japan alongside the new 30-series, until production finally ended in May 1978.

April 1974 brought rounder, bigger and heavier Corollas and Sprinters. The range was rounded out with the addition of a two-door [[liftback]]. The Corollas were given E30 codes while the Sprinters were given E40 codes. A face-lift in March 1976 saw most Corolla E30 models replaced by equivalent E50 models and most Sprinter E40 models were replaced by equivalent E60 models. The E30 Corolla was fitted with retracting front seat belts.

In Australia, KE3x was available as 4 door sedan, 2 door sedan, 2 door panel van (KE36) and 4 door wagon (KE38). All had 3K engines and K40 manual gearbox or 3 speed Auto. Sprinters were not available. Later KE5x models were available as 4 door sedan or 2 door coupe (A true pillar-less design) with 4K engine. The KE55 was 50&nbsp;kg heavier due to the addition of side impact protection in the doors, but due to a change in the body metal and seam sealing they are prone to rust. Later KE55 also used plastic ended bumper bars as opposed to the all chrome bumpers of the previous models, but included a rear sway bar for the first time.

A major restyle in March 1979 brought a square edged design. The Corollas had a simpler treatment of the grill, headlights and taillights while the Sprinter used a slightly more complex, sculptured treatment. The new A series engines were added to the range as a running change. This was the last model to use the K "hicam" and T series engines. Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option on Japanese market vehicles.

A sloping front [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] and a contemporary sharp-edged, no-frills style was brought in during May 1983. The new 1839 cc 1C diesel engine was added to the range with the E80 Series. From 1985, re-badged E80 Sprinters were sold in the U.S. as the fifth-generation [[Chevrolet Nova#Fifth generation|Chevrolet Nova]]. Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option internationally.

Most models now used the [[front wheel drive]] layout except the [[AE85]] and [[AE86]], which were to be the last Corollas offered in the [[rear wheel drive]] or FR layout. The AE85 and [[AE86]] chassis codes were also used for the [[Toyota Sprinter|Sprinter]] (including the Sprinter Trueno). The Sprinter was nearly identical to the Corolla, differing only by minor body styling changes such as [[pop-up headlights]].

A somewhat more rounded and aerodynamic style was used for the E90 introduced in May 1987. Overall this generation has a more refined feel than older Corollas and other older subcompacts. Most models were now [[front wheel drive]], along with a few [[4WD]] [[All-Trac]] models. Many engines were used on a wide array of trim levels and models, ranging from the 1.3-liter [[Toyota E engine#2E|2E]] to the {{convert|165|hp}} supercharged [[Toyota A engine#4A-GZE|4A-GZE]]. In the US, the E90 [[Toyota Sprinter|Sprinter]] was built and sold as both the Toyota Sprinter and the [[Geo Prizm]]. In Australia, the E90 Corolla was built and sold as both the Toyota Corolla and the [[Holden Nova]].

In June 1991 Corollas received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. In the United States, the somewhat larger Corolla was now in the compact class, rather than subcompact, and the coupé was still available in some markets, known as the AE101 Corolla Levin. Carburetors were mostly retired with this generation.

Production of the E110 Corolla started in May 1995. The design of the car was slightly altered throughout but retained a look similar to that of the E100. In 1998, for the first time, some non-Japanese Corollas received the new [[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ-FE|1ZZ-FE]] engine.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The new engine was the first in a Toyota to have an aluminum engine block and aluminum cylinder heads, which made this generation lighter than the E100 Corolla. The model range began to change as Toyota decided styling differences would improve sales in different markets.

This generation was delayed in North America until mid-1997 (US 1998 model year), where it had unique front and rear styling.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Europe and [[Australasia]] received versions of their own as well. In Pakistan, this model was halted in November 1998, while production was closed in March 2002.

In August 2000, the ninth-generation Corolla was introduced in Japan, with edgier styling and more technology to bring the nameplate into the 21st century. In 2002, the Corolla was given a refreshed facelift and it grew in length with similar body panels and interior. The facelifted Corolla since then is called '''Corolla Altis''' in the [[ASEAN]] region. The station wagon model is called the '''Corolla Fielder''' in Japan. The North American release was delayed until March 2002 (for the 2003 model year).

The tenth generation of the E140 Corolla was introduced in October 2006. Japanese markets called the sedan '''Corolla Axio'''. The station wagon retained the '''Corolla Fielder''' name.

=== International (E140/E150 wide; 2007–2013) ===
For international markets, a wider version of the E140 was sold with different styling, with the [[ASEAN]] markets retaining the '''Corolla Altis''' branding.

International markets continued on with the E140/E150 until at least 2013 when the E170 model arrived. The E170 is larger and substantially different from the Japanese E160, with a unique body and interior. Two basic front and rear styling treatments are fitted to the E170: a North American version that debuted first and a more conservative design for all other markets that debuted later in 2013.

In 2017, Toyota released a hatchback version in the US called the Corolla iM, a rebadged second generation facelifted [[Toyota Auris#E180|Auris]].
