The '''Macintosh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|t|ɒ|ʃ}} {{respell|MAK|in-tosh}}; branded as '''Mac''' since 1998) is a family of [[personal computer]]s (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] [[Steve Jobs]] introduced the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] computer on January 24, 1984. This was the company's first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral [[graphical user interface]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Polsson |first=Ken |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate= August 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |archivedate= August 21, 2009 }}</ref> This first model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the development of the first model.

The Macintosh was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the [[Commodore 64]] for consumers, as well as the [[IBM Personal Computer]] and its accompanying [[IBM PC compatible|clone]] market for businesses.<ref name="arstech">{{cite web |last= Reimer |first= Jeremy |title= Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |website= [[Ars Technica]]  |date= December 14, 2005 |url= https://arstechnica.com/features/2005/12/total-share/5/ |accessdate= April 16, 2015}}</ref> Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival [[Wintel]] platform, notably with the introduction of [[Windows 3.0]], then [[Windows 95]], gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of [[Motorola 68000 series|68000]]-based Macintosh systems was eroded by [[Intel]]'s [[Pentium]], and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as [[Compaq]] became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior [[PowerPC]]-based [[Power Macintosh]] (later renamed the Power Mac, in line with the [[PowerBook]]) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of [[Windows 95]] saw the Macintosh user base decline. 

In 1998, after the return of Steve Jobs, Apple consolidated its multiple consumer-level desktop models into the all-in-one [[iMac G3]], which became a commercial success and revitalized the brand. Since their [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|transition to Intel processors]] in 2006, the complete lineup is entirely based on said processors  and associated systems. Its current lineup comprises three [[Desktop computers|desktops]] (the all-in-one [[iMac]], entry-level [[Mac Mini]], and the [[Mac Pro]] [[computer graphics|graphics]] [[workstation]]), and three [[Laptop computer|laptops]] (the [[MacBook (Retina)|MacBook]], [[MacBook Air]], and the [[MacBook Pro]]). Its [[Xserve]] [[server (computing)|server]] was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.

Apple also develops the [[Mac OS|operating system for the Mac]], currently [[macOS]] (formerly known as OS X) version [[macOS Sierra|10.12 "Sierra"]]. Macs are currently capable of running non-Apple operating systems such as [[Linux]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] with the aid of [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] or third-party software. Apple does not [[Software license agreement|license]] macOS for use on non-Apple computers, though it did license previous versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] through their [[Macintosh clone#Official Macintosh clone program|Macintosh clone program]] from 1995 to 1997.

== Naming ==
The Macintosh project was begun in 1979 by [[Jef Raskin]], an Apple employee who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html |title=Recollections of the Macintosh project |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |first=Jef |last=Raskin |year=1996 |work=Articles from Jef Raskin about the history of the Macintosh. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072214/http://jef.raskincenter.org/published/holes.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}</ref> but the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh Laboratory, Inc.]], the audio equipment manufacturer.<ref name="raskin198405">{{cite news |url= https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Iyb4f_GMLWI3fgg2nPaAIsVtyWI9FA-UR5Nw-yqOLE/edit?usp=sharing |title= More Mac Reactions |work= [[BYTE]] |date=May 1984 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |author= Raskin, Jef |pages= 20 |type= letter}}</ref> [[Steve Jobs]] requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that Apple could use it, but the request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name.<ref>Apple confidential 2.0: the definitive history of the world's most colorful company, Owen W.

[[File:Apple Macintosh Desktop.png |thumb |left |alt=A screenshot of the original Mac OS. See caption.|The original 1984 [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] (System 1) desktop featured a radically new [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). Users communicated with the computer, using a [[Desktop metaphor|metaphorical desktop]] that included [[Computer icon|icons]] of [[real life]] items, instead of abstract textual [[Command-line interface|commands]].]]
In 1978 Apple began to organize the [[Apple Lisa]] project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced [[Apple III]] or the yet-to-be-introduced [[IBM PC]]. In 1979, [[Steve Jobs]] learned of the advanced work on [[graphical user interface]]s (GUI) taking place at [[Xerox PARC]]. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in action.<ref>{{cite web |last=Horn |first=Bruce |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt |publisher=Folklore.org |title= On Xerox, Apple and Progress |accessdate= February 3, 2007}}</ref> The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the [[state of the art]] for [[microprocessor]] capabilities; the [[Xerox Alto]] required a custom processor that spanned several [[circuit board]]s in a case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 32-bit [[Motorola 68000]] in 1979, which offered at least an [[order of magnitude]] better performance than existing designs, and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs' continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.<ref>{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Jeffrey S. Young, William L. |title= iCon : Steve Jobs, the greatest second act in the history of business |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] (retrieved via Google Books) |location= Hoboken, NJ |isbn= 978-0471787846 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv6RHwAACAAJ |edition= Newly updated. |accessdate= 2014-01-06 |date= 2006-04-14}}</ref>

At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979,  [[Jef Raskin]] started the Macintosh project. The design at that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a [[text-based user interface]] that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command keys on the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979,<ref name="Father of Mac">{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first= Andy |authorlink= Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt&showcomments=1#comments |publisher= Folklore.org |title= The father of the Macintosh |accessdate= April 24, 2006}}</ref> and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him.<ref name="Eulogy for Brian">{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |authorlink= Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Eulogy_for_Brian&sortOrder=Sort+by+Date&characters=Brian+Howardcomments=1#comments |publisher= Folklore.org |title= Eulogy for Brian |accessdate= April 5, 2014}}</ref> His initial team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Burrell Smith]], and [[Bud Tribble]].<ref name=hertz2>{{cite book |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |title=[[Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made]] |url= |location= |publisher= Oreilly |page= xxiii |isbn= |date=2005 }}</ref> The rest of the original Mac team would include [[Bill Atkinson]], Bob Belleville, [[Steve Capps]], [[George Crow]], Donn Denman, [[Chris Espinosa]], [[Andy Hertzfeld]], [[Bruce Horn]], [[Susan Kare]], Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with [[Steve Jobs]] leading the project.<ref name=hertz1>{{cite book |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |title= Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac was Made |url= |location= |publisher= Oreilly |page= xxi-xxiv |isbn= |date=2005 }}</ref>

Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64&nbsp;[[kilobytes]] (kB) of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], used the 8-bit [[Motorola 6809]]E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-[[pixel]] [[black-and-white]] [[Raster graphics|bitmap]] display. [[Bud Tribble]], a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the [[Apple Lisa]]'s graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's [[Motorola 68000 microprocessor]] into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from the Lisa's 5&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] to 8&nbsp;MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete [[QuickDraw]] picture language and interpreter in 64&nbsp;KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]]&nbsp;– far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8&nbsp;KB of ROM; it had 128&nbsp;kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-[[kilobit]] (kb) RAM chips [[solder]]ed to the [[motherboard|logicboard]]. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512&nbsp;kB by means of soldering sixteen [[Integrated circuit|IC]] sockets to accept 256&nbsp;kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a {{convert|9|in |adj=on}}, 512x342 pixel [[monochrome]] display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |publisher= Folklore.org |authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Five_Different_Macs.txt |title=Five different Macintoshes |accessdate= April 24, 2006}}</ref><!--This sources the entire paragraph.-->

Burrel's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an [[Apple II]] with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000 CPU, began to receive Jobs' attentions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hertzfeld |first=Andy |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Square_Dots.txt&topic=Hardware%20Design&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date |publisher= Folklore.org |title=Square Dots |accessdate= July 24, 2012}}</ref> Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's.<ref name="Father of Mac"/> When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted his entire attentions to the Macintosh.

Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last. Following an internal power struggle with then-new Apple CEO [[John Sculley]], Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=The_End_Of_An_Era.txt|title=The End Of An Era|first=Andy|last=Hertzfeld|authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|work=folklore.org}}</ref> He went on to found [[NeXT]], another computer company which targeted the education market,<ref>{{cite news|last=Spector|first=G|title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market|work=[[eWeek|PCWeek]]|page=109|date=September 24, 1985}}</ref> and did not return until 1997, when Apple acquired NeXT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q2/970207.pr.rel.next.html |title=Apple Computer, Inc.

Jobs commissioned industrial designer [[Hartmut Esslinger]] to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the [[Snow White design language|"Snow White" design language]]; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Ed|url=http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/design2.html|title=History of computer design: Snow White|publisher=Landsnail.com|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}</ref>

In 1985, the combination of the Mac, Apple's [[LaserWriter]] printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's [[MacPublisher]] and [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as [[desktop publishing]].

The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily. It also lacked a [[hard disk drive]] or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984, Apple introduced the [[Macintosh 512K]], with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195.<ref name="512_specs">{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh 512K]]|appleNumber=SP187|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_512k.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board.

Apple released the [[Macintosh Plus]] on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one [[megabyte]] of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of [[SIMM|socketed RAM boards]]. It also featured a [[SCSI]] parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its [[Macintosh External Disk Drive|floppy drive]] was increased to an 800&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history.<ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh Plus]]|appleNumber=SP190|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_plus.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]], an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than [[cross compiling]] from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled [[HyperCard]] and [[MultiFinder]], which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.

[[File:MacII.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Macintosh II with a separate monitor and CPU|The [[Macintosh II]], the first Macintosh model with color graphics]]
Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the [[Macintosh II]] at $5500, powered by a {{nowrap|16&nbsp;MHz}} [[Motorola 68020]] processor.<ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh II]]|appleNumber=SP193|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_ii.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color [[QuickDraw]] in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an [[open architecture]] with several [[NuBus]] expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=160|title=Apple Macintosh II|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Old Computers On-line Museum}}</ref> One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA40560 |title=Macintosh II Family: Fan Regulator Voids Warranty|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Apple|date=July 2, 1992}}</ref> Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.

[[File:Macintosh SE b.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Macintosh II SE|The [[Macintosh SE]], updated [[Compact Macintosh]] design using [[Snow White design language]]]]
The [[Macintosh SE]] was released at the same time as the Macintosh II for $2900 (or $3900 with hard drive), as the first [[Compact Macintosh|compact Mac]] with a 20&nbsp;MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot.<ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE]]|appleNumber=SP191|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apple Service Source: Apple SE/30|accessdate=November 16, 2010|url=http://www.apple-collection.com/CarPos/macse30.pdf}}</ref> The SE also updated [[Jerry Manock]] and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's ''[[Snow White design language|Snow White]]'' design language, as well as the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) [[Apple Mouse#Apple Desktop Bus Mouse (G5431/A9M0331)|mouse]] and [[Apple Keyboard#Apple Keyboard (M0116)|keyboard]] that had first appeared on the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II<small>GS</small>]] some months earlier.

In 1987, Apple spun off its software business as [[Claris]]. It was given the code and rights to several applications, most notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and [[MacProject]]. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the "Pro" series, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the [[Informix Wingz]] [[spreadsheet]] program on the Mac, renaming it [[Claris Resolve]], and added the new presentation software [[Claris Impact]]. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released [[AppleWorks|ClarisWorks]], which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation|url=http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php|title=A Brief History of ClarisWorks|accessdate=December 24, 2007|year=2003|author=Hearm, Bob}}</ref>

In 1988, Apple [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|sued]] Microsoft and [[Hewlett-Packard]] on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyrighted GUI, citing (among other things) the use of rectangular, overlapping, and resizable windows. After four years, the case was decided against Apple, as were later [[United States court of appeals|appeals]]. Apple's actions were criticized by some in the software community, including the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), who felt Apple was trying to monopolize on GUIs in general, and boycotted GNU software for the Macintosh platform for seven years.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=Special Report: Apple's New Look and Feel|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html#SEC9|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=5|date= June 11, 1988 |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=End of Apple Boycott|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull18.html#SEC13|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=18|date=January 1995|accessdate=April 25, 2006}}</ref>

With the new [[Motorola 68030]] processor came the [[Macintosh IIx]] in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board [[memory management unit|MMU]].<ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIx]]|appleNumber=SP194|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iix.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> It was followed in 1989 by  the [[Macintosh IIcx]], a more compact version with fewer slots <ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIcx]]|everyURL=apple/mac_ii/stats/mac_iicx.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> and a version of the Mac SE powered by the {{nowrap|16&nbsp;MHz}} 68030, the [[Macintosh SE/30]].<ref>{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE/30]]|appleNumber=SP195|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se30.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}</ref> Later that year, the [[Macintosh IIci]], running at {{nowrap|25&nbsp;MHz}}, was the first Mac to be "[[32-bit clean]]."

===1990–98: Decline and transition to PowerPC===
[[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]] was released in May 1990, and according to a common saying at the time "Windows was not as good as Macintosh, but it was good enough for the average user". Though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS, 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform. It also did not help matters that during the previous year [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers. Finally, there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices, which dropped Apple's margins.<ref name=lowend_2013_0817/>

As for Mac OS, [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] was a [[32-bit]] rewrite from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] to [[C++]] that introduced [[virtual memory]] and improved the handling of color graphics, as well as memory addressing, networking, and [[co-operative multitasking]]. Also during this time, the Macintosh began to shed the [[Snow White design language|"Snow White" design language]], along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to [[Frogdesign]].

Intel had tried unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh platform to Intel chips.

In 1993 Intel rolled out the [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology.

Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers. At one point, its product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.<ref name="Apple Computer">{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=12707 |title=Macintosh Centris, Quadra 660AV: Description (Discontinued)|author=Apple Computer|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=June 19, 1995}}</ref> These models competed against [[Macintosh clone]]s, hardware manufactured by third parties to whom Apple had licensed [[System 7]]. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat, and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, while Apple continued to bear the burden of developing [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]].

Apple's [[market share]] further struggled due to the release of the [[Windows 95]] operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows substantially nearer to parity with Mac OS.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 following the company's purchase of NeXT, he ordered that the OS that had been previewed as System 7.7 be branded [[Mac OS 8]], a name Apple had previously wished to preserve for the never-to-appear next generation [[Copland (operating system)|Copland OS]]. This maneuver effectively ended the clone lines, as Apple had only licensed System 7 to clone manufacturers, not Mac OS 8. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like [[Motorola]], who produced the [[Motorola StarMax|StarMax]]; Umax, who produced the SuperMac;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/umax/index-umax-supermac-mac-clones.html|title=Umax Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}</ref> and [[Power Computing Corporation|Power Computing]], who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/powercc/index-power-computing-mac-clones.html|title=PowerComputing Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}</ref> These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.<ref name=lowend_2007_0830/>
Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax' license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost USD$36 million on the program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256|title=Apple Confidential}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/2014/apple-squeezes-mac-clones-out-of-the-market/|title=Apple Squeezed Mac Clones out of the Market|quote=Umax stretched out its license as long as possible, and Apple even offered Umax the chance to continue in the sub-$1,000 market, but without the more profitable high-end models, the SuperMac division would not be viable. Even though Umax was the lone cloner to acquire a Mac OS 8 license and actually shipped some computers with OS 8, it was too little, too late. On May 27, 1998, Umax threw in the towel, the last of the Mac clone makers to fall.

In 1998, Apple introduced its new [[iMac]] which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue]] and later various additional colors, is considered an [[industrial design]] landmark of the late 1990s.

The iMac also marked Apple's transition from the "Macintosh" name to the more simplistic "Mac". Apple completed elimination of the Macintosh product name in 1999, when "Power Macintosh" was retired with the introduction of the [[Power Mac G4]].

In early 2001, Apple began shipping computers with [[CD-RW]] drives and emphasized the Mac's ability to play DVDs by including [[DVD-ROM]] and [[DVD-RAM]] drives as standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan092001id37951.htm |title=Speed, Song Highlight Apple Product Announcements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029065952/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan092001id37951.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2008 |df= }}</ref> Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been "late to the party" on writable CD technology, but felt that Macs could become a "digital hub" that linked and enabled an "emerging digital lifestyle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Apple-picks-up-the-beat-with-CD-RW-drives/2100-1040_3-249578.html|title=Apple picks up the beat with CD-RW drives}}</ref> Apple would later introduce an update to its [[iTunes]] music player software that enabled it to burn CDs, along with a controversial "Rip, Mix, Burn" advertising campaign that some<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3744/2002/03/eisner2.html|title=Disney boss accuses Apple of fostering piracy|date=March 1, 2002|work=Macworld}}</ref> felt encouraged [[media piracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/complete_itunes_history_soundjam_mp_itunes_9|title=The Complete iTunes History – SoundJam MP to iTunes 9}}</ref> This accompanied the release of the [[iPod]], Apple's first successful [[Mobile device|handheld device]].

On January 11, 2005, Apple announced the [[Mac Mini]], priced at US$499, making it the cheapest Mac.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple Changes Course With Low-Priced Mac|first1=John|last1=Markoff|first2=Saul|last2=Hansell| authorlink = John Markoff | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/technology/12apple.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=January 16, 2006}}</ref><ref name=BBCunveil>{{cite journal|title=Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini'|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4162009.stm|accessdate=April 28, 2010 | date=January 11, 2005|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a [[nanokernel]] and support for [[Multi-core (computing)|Multiprocessing Services]] 2.0 in [[Mac OS 8.6]], though its dated architecture made replacement necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/PPCSoftware/PPCSoftware-12.html#HEADING12-0|title=Apple Developer Connection&nbsp;– Overview of the PowerPC System Software|publisher=Apple|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> Initially developed in the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] programming language, it was substantially rewritten in [[C++]] for System 7.

Since its architecture was laid down, features that were already common on Apple's competition, like [[preemptive multitasking]] and [[protected memory]], had become feasible on the kind of hardware Apple manufactured. As such, Apple introduced [[OS X|Mac OS X]], a fully overhauled [[Unix]]-based successor to [[Mac OS 9]]. OS X uses [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], [[XNU]], and [[Mach kernel|Mach]] as [[Architecture of OS X|foundations]], and is based on [[NeXTSTEP]]. It was released to the public in September 2000, as the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]], featuring a revamped [[user interface]] called "[[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]". At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple Breaks The Mold|first=J.D.|last=Biersdorfer|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DD1538F937A2575AC0A9669C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2000|accessdate=January 16, 2008}}</ref> The initial version of Mac OS X, [[Mac OS X v10.0|10.0]] "Cheetah", was released on March 24, 2001.

Subsequent releases of Mac OS X included [[Mac OS X v10.1|10.1 "Puma"]] (2001), [[Mac OS X v10.2|10.2 "Jaguar"]] (2002), [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3 "Panther"]] (2003) and [[Mac OS X v10.4|10.4 "Tiger"]] (2005).

===2005–present: Switch to Intel x86===
Apple [[Apple–Intel transition|discontinued]] the use of [[PowerPC]] microprocessors in 2006.

These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency and the ability to implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.

Apple contracts hardware production to Asian [[original equipment manufacturer]]s such as [[Foxconn]] and [[Pegatron]], maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. By contrast, most other companies (including [[Microsoft]]) create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of [[Third-party developer|third parties]] such as [[Dell]], [[HP Inc.]]/[[Hewlett-Packard]]/[[Compaq]], and [[Lenovo]]. Consequently, the Macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options, but has superior integration compared to a Microsoft buyer.

The current Mac product family uses [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[x86-64]] [[Central processing unit|processors]]. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from [[PowerPC]] chips (called [[Rosetta (binary translation software)|Rosetta]]), much as it did during the transition from [[Motorola 68000]] architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,933453,00.asp|title=Apple Switch | work=PC Magazine | first=John C.|last=Dvorak|date=March 18, 2003}}</ref> and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[RAM]] as standard other than the 1.4&nbsp;GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook Air. Current Mac computers use [[Radeon|ATI/AMD Radeon]] or [[GeForce|Nvidia GeForce]] [[graphics card]]s as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the [[MacBook Pro]] without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a [[SuperDrive]]. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: [[USB 3.0|USB]] and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] (except for the [[MacBook (Retina)|Retina MacBook]], which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the "Thunderbolt" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.<ref>{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Phillip|title=New Mac minis add Thunderbolt, lose optical drive|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1161242/mac_mini.html|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>  USB was introduced in the 1998 [[iMac G3]] and is ubiquitous today,<ref name="eight ways" /> while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras.

==Software==
{{Main article|Macintosh operating systems}}
{{Further information|Classic Mac OS|macOS}}
The original Macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] devoid of a [[command line]]. It uses a [[desktop metaphor]], depicting real-world objects like [[computer file|documents]] and a [[trash (computing)|trash can]] as [[icon (computing)|icons]] on-screen. Now known as the [[classic Mac OS]], the [[Classic Mac OS|System]] software was introduced in 1984 with the first Macintosh, renamed [[System 7#Mac OS 7.6|Mac OS]] in 1997, and continued to evolve until version [[Mac OS 9|9.2.2]].

Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the [[classic Mac OS]] system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, is to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based [[bootloader]] application. Used even by Apple for [[A/UX]] and [[MkLinux]], this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of [[Open Firmware]]-based [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many [[Old World ROM]] systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Since then, Mac hardware boots directly from [[Open Firmware]] in most [[PowerPC]]-based Macs or [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] in all [[Intel-based Macs]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 2001, Apple introduced [[macOS|Mac OS X]] (renamed [[macOS|OS X]] in 2012 and [[macOS]] in 2016), based on [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and [[NeXTSTEP]]; its new features included the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]] and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] user interface. During the transition, Apple included a [[virtual machine]] [[compatibility layer|subsystem]] known as [[Classic Environment|Classic]], allowing users to run [[Mac OS 9]] applications under [[Mac OS X 10.4]] and earlier on [[PowerPC]] machines. Because macOS is a [[Unix]] operating system that borrows heavily from [[FreeBSD]], many applications written for [[Linux kernel|Linux]]<!--do not fix--> or [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] run on it, often using [[X Window System|X11]]. There are many popular [[List of Macintosh software|Macintosh software applications]]; many of those from large developers, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] are actively developed for both macOS and Windows. A large amount of [[open-source software]] applications, such as the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]] and the [[LibreOffice]] [[office suite]], are [[cross-platform]], and thereby also run natively on macOS.

Following the release of [[Intel-based Macs]], third-party [[platform virtualization]] software such as [[Parallels Desktop]], [[VMware Fusion]], and [[VirtualBox]] began to emerge. These programs allow users to run [[Microsoft Windows]] or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] and Mac-specific Windows [[Device driver|drivers]] that help users to install [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista|Vista]] and natively [[dual boot]] between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, it is possible to run the [[Linux]] operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization [[workaround]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul J.

==Market share and user demographics==

===1984–97: Success and decline===
Since the introduction of the Macintosh, Apple has struggled to gain a significant [[market share|share]] of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM's PC]], resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74&nbsp;days for 50,000&nbsp;units to sell.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polsson |first=Ken |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2009 |df= }} See April 7, 1984.</ref> Although Apple was not able to overcome the tidal wave of IBM PCs and its clones,<ref name="arstech" /><ref name="libes198509">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n401/mode/2up | title=The Top Ten | work=BYTE | date=September 1985 | accessdate=October 27, 2013 | author=Libes, Sol | pages=418}}</ref><ref name="kennedy19850416">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtmJgtfaxz8C&lpg=PA7&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=PCs Rated Number One | work=PC Magazine | date=April 16, 1985 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=Kennedy, Don | pages=42}}</ref><ref name="sandler198411">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/298_IBM_colossus_of_Armonk.php | title=IBM: Colossus of Armonk | work=Creative Computing | date=November 1984 | accessdate=February 26, 2013 | author=Sandler, Corey | pages=298}}</ref><ref name="sanger19850805">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/05/us/philip-estridge-dies-in-jet-crash-guided-ibm-personal-computer.html | title=Philip Estridge Dies in Jet Crash; Guided IBM Personal Computer | work=The New York Times | date=August 5, 1985 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Sanger, David E.}}</ref><ref name="sanger19850805"/> Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing.

Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive in light of the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. [[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]] was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh.<ref name=lowend_2013_0817/> Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.<ref name="Apple Computer"/>

[[Compaq]], who had previously held the third place spot among PC manufacturers during the 1980s and early/mid-1990s, initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.<ref name="Money.cnn.com"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Fisher"/> Apple's [[market share]] further struggled due to the release of the [[Windows 95]] operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS [[GUI]].

===1997–2007: Comeback===
In 1997, upon return to Apple as interim CEO, Steve Jobs terminated the Macintosh clone program while simplifying the computer product lines. If measuring market share by installed base, there were more than 20&nbsp;million Mac users by 1997, compared to an installed base of around 340&nbsp;million [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Apple Computer]] |date=December 19, 1997 |url=https://developer.apple.com/adcnews/pastissues/devnews121997.html#stats |title=Apple Developer News, No. 87 |accessdate=April 24, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905184109/http://developer.apple.com/adcnews/pastissues/devnews121997.html |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Computer Industry Almanac Inc |date=November 3, 1998 |url=http://www.c-i-a.com/pr1198.htm |title=Nearly 600 Million Computers-in-Use in Year 2000 |accessdate=June 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617181908/http://c-i-a.com/pr1198.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2006 |df= }}</ref>

In 1998, the release of the [[iMac G3]] all-in-one was a great success, selling 800,000 units in 139 days, providing a much needed boost to the ailing Macintosh platform.<ref name="Apple"/><ref name="Markoff, John"/> The introduction of the [[Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White)|Power Macintosh]] and [[iBook]] laptop completed "four-square product matrix" (''desktop'' and ''portable'' products for both ''consumers'' and ''professionals''), with the iBook ranking as the most popular laptop in the U.S. market for 1999.<ref name="iBook: An iMac to Go"/><ref name="The Mac Observer"/><ref name="apple.com"/>

In 2000, Apple released the [[Power Mac G4 Cube]], their first desktop since the discontinued [[Power Mac G3#Outriggers|Power Macintosh G3]], to slot between the [[iMac G3]] and the [[Power Mac G4]]. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced [[United States dollar|US$]]200 higher than the comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales.<ref name=ars>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/reviews/4q00/g4cube_cd/g4-cube-3.html |title=G4 Cube & Cinema Display (review) |work=[[Ars Technica]] |first=John |last=Siracusa}}</ref> Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1153341/cube_10thanniversary.html|title=The Cube at 10: Why Apple's eye-catching desktop flopped|author=Benj Edwards|date=August 12, 2010|work=Macworld|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in July 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2001/jul/03cube.html |title=Apple - Press Info - Apple Puts Power Mac G4 Cube on Ice |publisher= |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608033435/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2001/jul/03cube.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

Starting in 2002, Apple moved to eliminate CRT displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space-saving measures with the [[iMac G4]]. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the [[eMac]] in April 2002 as the intended successor; however the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at much lower cost than the iMac G4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2002/11/11/review-gateway-profile-4-vs-apple-imac/|title=Review: Gateway Profile 4 vs. Apple iMac|work=BetaNews|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the [[iPod]] portable music player and [[iTunes]] music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.

Statistics from late 2003 indicate that Apple had 2.06&nbsp;percent of the desktop share in the United States that had increased to 2.88&nbsp;percent by Q4&nbsp;2004.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dalrymple|first=Jim|date= April 20, 2005 |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/03/20/marketshare/index.php|title=Apple desktop market share on the rise; will the Mac mini, iPod help?|publisher=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}</ref> As of October 2006, research firms [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] and [[Gartner]] reported that Apple's market share in the U.S. had increased to about 6&nbsp;percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dalrymple|first=Jim|date= October 19, 2006|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/10/19/marketshare/index.php|title=Apple's Mac market share tops 5% with over 30% growth|publisher=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=December 22, 2006}}</ref> Figures from December 2006, showing a market share around 6&nbsp;percent (IDC) and 6.1&nbsp;percent (Gartner) are based on a more than 30&nbsp;percent increase in unit sale from 2005 to 2006.

In recent years, Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs.<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/hardware/apple-macintosh/black-friday-unusual-apple-deals/240142480 Black Friday: Unusual Apple Deals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127170421/http://www.informationweek.com/hardware/apple-macintosh/black-friday-unusual-apple-deals/240142480 |date=November 27, 2012 }}, InformationWeek, November 23, 2012.</ref> This has been attributed, in part, to the success of the [[iPod]] and the [[iPhone]], a [[halo effect]] whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple products, and Apple has since capitalized on that with the [[iCloud]] cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and Macs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=Apple Aims for the Masses With a Cheaper iPhone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/technology/10apple.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Nonetheless, like other [[personal computer]] manufacturers, the Macintosh lines have been hurt by [[Post-PC era|consumer trend]] towards [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s (particularly Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]], respectively) as the computing devices of choice among consumers.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apples-holiday-macbook-sales-down-6-in-2012-pcs-down-11 | title = Apple's Holiday MacBook Sales Down 6% in 2012, PCs down 11% | newspaper = The Mac Observer}}.</ref>

Although the PC market declined, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million [[MacBook]]s in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the [[MacBook Air]]) compared to 500,000 total [[Ultrabooks]],<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/macbook-air-continues-to-trounce-ultrabooks | title = MacBook Air Continues to Trounce Ultrabooks | newspaper = Trusted Reviews}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.macworld.co.uk/macsoftware/news/?newsid=3401805 | title = MacBook Air continues to dominate Ultrabook market, while competition awaits Windows 8 | newspaper = Macworld | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.</ref> although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.cultofmac.com/178923/the-macbook-air-is-killing-ultrabook-sales/ | title = The MacBook Air Is Killing Ultrabook Sales | newspaper = Cult of Mac}}.</ref> The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States.<ref name=ubreview_2013_1126/> While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to "OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronista.com/articles/13/07/01/haswell.os.x.mavericks.efficiencies.expected.to.further.boost.share/#ixzz2j1bd4V4X.|title=NPD: MacBook Air owns 56 percent of the US ultrabook market|author=author|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years.<ref name="venturebeat.com"/><ref name="MacBook Air vs. Ultrabooks"/> Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronista.com/articles/13/07/01/haswell.os.x.mavericks.efficiencies.expected.to.further.boost.share/|title=NPD: MacBook Air owns 56 percent of the US ultrabook market|author=author|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air.<ref name=ubreview_2013_1126/> The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established "elitist aura" perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2014/08/11/three-reasons-the-surface-pro-3-is-struggling/|title=Three Reasons The Surface Pro 3 Is Struggling|date=August 11, 2014|work=Forbes|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

Apple has generally dominated the premium PC market, having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $1,000 in 2009, according to [[NPD Group|NPD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/259141/why_ultrabook_sales_have_flopped_so_far.html|title=Why Ultrabook Sales Have Flopped So Far|author=Jared Newman|date=July 12, 2012|work=PCWorld|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, compared to 13 percent for [[Dell Inc.|Dell]], seven percent for [[Hewlett Packard]], six percent for [[Lenovo]] and Asus, and one percent for Acer.<ref name="zdnet.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2013/04/17/apple_macs_profits/|title=PC floggers scavenge for crumbs as Apple hoovers up profits.|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs.<ref name="zdnet.com"/> It also helped that the Macintosh lineup is simple, updated on a yearly schedule, and consistent across both Apple retail stores, and authorized resellers where they have a special "store within a store" section to distinguish them from Windows PCs. In contrast, Windows PC manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings, selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web, and often with limited-time or region-specific models. The Macintosh ranked third on the "list of intended brands for desktop purchases" for the 2011 holiday season, then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard, and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-desktops-overtake-dell-on-shoppers-holiday-wish-lists/|title=Apple desktops overtake Dell on shoppers' holiday wish lists|work=CNET|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>
