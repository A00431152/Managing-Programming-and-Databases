Local councillor Darren Fisher says hundreds of people gathered at P02 Craig Blake Memorial Park, formerly Montebello Park, for an emotional ceremony on Saturday afternoon.

Fisher says Blake’s family, as well as Halifax Mayor Mike Savage, local politicians and military personnel were on hand for the event.

He says the ceremony included a moving speech from Blake’s wife Priscilla Blake and a flypast by a Sea King helicopter.

Blake had only been in the country for a couple of weeks.
