Rapper Nas gets fellowship
THE CHRONICLE HERALD
NEW YORK (AP) — Nas has rapped his way to Harvard University.

The Ivy League school announced Tuesday that the 39-year-old rapper is being honoured with the Nasir Jones Hip-Hop Fellowship at its W.E.B. Du Bois Institute. It’s a joint venture with Harvard’s Hip-Hop Archive.

The fellowship will assist students who excel in the arts “in connection with hip-hop.”

Nas is one of hip-hop’s most celebrated lyricists, best known for his reflective rhymes and deep storytelling. His 11th album, Life Is Good, was released last year. It earned four Grammy nominations. His hits include If I Ruled the World (Imagine That), Street Dreams and I Can.

The Hip-Hop Archive was established at Harvard in 2002. It supports growing research in hip-hop.
