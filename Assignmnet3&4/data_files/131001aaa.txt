THE HERALD NEWS
A former president of the Technical University of Nova Scotia who ran for the provincial Tories has died.

J. Clair Callaghan, 80, passed away Sept. 26 at his home in Halifax.

In 1988, Callaghan ran for the provincial Tories in the Halifax Chebucto riding, losing by just 26 votes to NDP provincial leader Alexa McDonough, who would later go on to lead the federal NDP.

He ran for the provincial leadership in 1991, losing in the first ballot in a vote that made Donald Cameron leader of the provincial party. Cameron served as premier from 1991 to 1993.

Callaghan made another unsuccessful bid for the Halifax Chebucto seat, but lost out again. This time, the seat went Liberal and the Tories were swept from power.

A professor before entering politics, he was also a businessman and consultant.

An online obituary said he was president of Clairtel NF Limited and “held patents for the Haul-Down system (Bear-trap) used in the Canadian Navy and elsewhere.” (The system is used to secure choppers and haul them down to land safely on a ship’s deck, particularly in rough seas.)

The obituary also said Callaghan was a consultant on several of projects and served on a number of regional and national committees. He also received an honourary doctorate in engineering in 2001 from Dalhousie University and honourary doctorates from Concordia University and the University of PEI.

A funeral for Callaghan, who is survived by his wife, children and grandchildren, was held this morning in Halifax. Burial is scheduled for Wednesday in Prince Edward Island, where he was born.
