One-way fares for the nine-hour cruise aboard the brand-new, 161-metre cruise ferry Nova Star will range from US$79 to $129 for adults and $39 to $64 for children five to 12 years of age, depending on the date of travel. Children under the age of five will travel free all season.

Passengers can walk on board the Nova Star or bring their own transportation, at rates from $129 to $179 for autos, $49 to $89 for motorcycles and $16 to $22 for bicycles, depending on the season.

“The lower fares are intended to boost demand at the beginning and end of the sailing season, while the higher fares will be in effect during the peak summer period,” Owen John, vice-president, sales and marketing, Nova Star Cruises, said in a news release.

Nova Star Cruises will provide the cruise ferry service from May 1 to Nov. 2.

The company estimates that more than 100,000 passengers will use the ferry in the first year of operation.
